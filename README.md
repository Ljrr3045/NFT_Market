# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

**********************************************************
This project consists of two branches:

1.- Master: Branch only for the project with the smart contracts <br>
2.- ReactProject: Everything mentioned above is found, added to this a react project for a Dapp Front End
**********************************************************
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
